# Bayesian-Optimisation-for-Quantitative-Trading
# README
# Overview:
# This script implements a realistic backtesting framework for a forex trading strategy on the GBP/JPY pair using OANDA's API. It fetches H4 candlestick data, detects trading signals based on equal highs and lows, and optimizes parameters (tolerance, stop-loss, take-profit) using Bayesian optimization. The backtester simulates real-world conditions like slippage, partial fills, spreads, and commissions. Performance metrics (pips, win rate, Sharpe ratio, etc.) are calculated, and an institutional-style summary is provided. The script is designed to run in Google Colab.
#
# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Open Google Colab (colab.research.google.com) and create a new notebook.
# 2. Install required libraries: `!pip install oandapyV20 bayesian-optimization`.
# 3. Set up your OANDA API key:
#    - Replace `OANDA_API_KEY = "YOUR_OANDA_API_KEY_HERE"` with your key.
#    - Alternatively, use Colab's input prompt: `OANDA_API_KEY = input("Enter OANDA API key: ")`.
#    - Do not hardcode credentials in the script to ensure security.
# 4. Copy and paste this code into a cell and run it using Shift + Enter.
# 5. Review outputs: backtest results for each iteration, best parameters, top 5 by win rate, and institutional summary (pips, Sharpe ratio, monthly performance, trade durations).
#
# Dependencies:
# - Python 3.x
# - Libraries: oandapyV20, pandas, numpy, bayesian-optimization
# - Note: Install `oandapyV20` and `bayesian-optimization` in Colab; pandas and numpy are pre-installed.
#
# Adapting to Your Needs:
# - Change the instrument by modifying `instrument = "GBP_JPY"` (e.g., to "EUR_USD").
# - Adjust the time frame by changing `granularity = "H4"` (e.g., to "H1", "D").
# - Modify the date range in `start_time` and `end_time` for different periods.
# - Update `pbounds` to change optimization ranges for `tolerance`, `sl_pips`, or `tp_pips`.
# - Customize the `detect_equal_highs_lows` function to implement your own signal logic.
# - Adjust `pip_value`, `slippage`, `spread`, or `commission_per_lot` in `RealisticBacktester` to match your broker’s conditions.
#
# Notes:
# - Ensure a stable internet connection, as the script fetches data from OANDA’s API.
# - The script uses a practice environment (`environment="practice"`). For live trading, update to `environment="live"` with caution.
# - Bayesian optimization runs 120 iterations, which may take time depending on data size and Colab’s resources.
# - Cache is used to avoid redundant API calls; clear `tester.cached_data` if data updates are needed.
# - For large datasets, monitor Colab’s memory usage to avoid crashes.
# - Contact for support or enhancements (e.g., adding new metrics, strategies, or visualizations).
